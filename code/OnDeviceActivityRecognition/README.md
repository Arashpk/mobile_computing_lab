# Activity Recognition with Transfer Learning

This folder provide an end-to-end solution for on-device training, inference and data collection for activity recongition based on <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/model_personalization">TFlite Transfer Learning Pipeline</a>. The corresponding blog post is available <a href="https://aqibsaeed.github.io/on-device-activity-recognition">here</a>.
