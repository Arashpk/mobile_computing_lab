# HandWrittenDigist App

This app is based on the implementation for older versions of TensorFlow [kindly provided and nicely explained here](https://github.com/llSourcell/A_Guide_to_Running_Tensorflow_Models_on_Android/tree/master/mnistandroid). This app works with TensorFlow Lite and requires TensorFlow > 1.9.1

This app is part of the [Workshop 3, Mobile Computing Lab @ TU Graz](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/mobile_computing_lab/WS3_2_Detecting_Handwritten_Digits.ipynb)
