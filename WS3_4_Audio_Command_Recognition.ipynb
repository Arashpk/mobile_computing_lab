    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show you how to runs a simple speech recognition TensorFlow model built using the audio training.Real speech and audio recognition systems are much more complex, but like MNIST for images, it should give you a basic understanding of the techniques involved. Once you’ve completed this tutorial, you’ll have a application that tries to classify a one second audio clip as either silence, an unknown word, “yes”, “no”, “up”, “down”, “left”, “right”, “on”, “off”, “stop”, or “go”.\n",
