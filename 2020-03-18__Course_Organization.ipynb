    "The course provides an introduction to the current research trends in the area of mobile computing. The course will be based on a programming project, where students will form groups of 1-2 students to develop a smartphone app for Android (or iOS). There is no disadvantage of implementing a project alone! To program a smartphone app, a developer needs to be familiar with (1) the signals and data that smartphones can gather, and (2) the mathematical tools necessary to process this data. This course will provide a solid background for the above two points. During the workshops we will analyze the latest research papers on this emerging field. We will dissect these papers to understand how techniques from algorithms, signal processing, and machine learning are used to develop some exciting applications. The students will then use these basic technical tools to develop their own apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course you will get familiar with:\n",
    "* Sensors and signals your smartphone can gather;\n",
    "* Mathematical tools necessary to process sensor data;\n",

    "## Project Options\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is based on a programming project. Three options are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Activity monitoring and tranfer learning\n",
    "The project is for beginners and consists of two parts: First, you will read sensor data provided by your phone (e.g., acceleration values) and use different algorithms (e.g., kNN) to detect the type of activity (e.g., jogging, walking, sitting, standing) you are currently doing. In the second part of the project, you will have to change the location of your phone (e.g., hold it in your hand instead of in your pocket) and use transfer learning to adjust the model quickly on your device device.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<img src=\"img/sensors/project_option_1_acceleration_data.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "Expected path:\n",
    "   * Week 1-3: Activity monitoring (e.g., based on kNN)\n",
    "   * Week 4-6: Transfer learning\n",
    "   * Week 7: GUI\n",
    "   * Week 8: Polish your code, measure performance, write final report\n",
    "   * Week 9: Demonstration (in the virtual classroom)\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Option 2: Speech processing on a mobile phone\n",
    "\n",
    "Great public speakers are made, not born. Practicing a presentation in front of colleagues is common practice in the academic world and results in a set of subjective judgements what could be improved. In this project, you will design and implementation a mobile app which evaluates the quality of a certain aspect of speaker’s delivery in real time in a fair, repeatable and privacy-preserving way. Your app should perform speech processing __in real time and locally on your smartphone__. You may choose to assess one of the following delivery aspects: \n",
    "   1. Word counting (see: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263272600_A_Speech_System_for_Estimating_Daily_Word_Counts\">A Speech System for Estimating Daily Word Counts</a>, INTERSPEECH 2014)\n",
    "   2. Filler word detection (e.g., ehm, ahm, like, basically, eh, ah, see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNrD-6W3GkI\">English Filler Words</a>)\n",
    "   3. Detecting speaker's emotional load on different blocks of a talk (see <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.Xm5acS3Mz_Q\">RAVDESS data set</a>)\n",
    "   4. Uptalk detection (see: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfMwri22SM\">What is Uptalk?</a>)\n",
    "   5. Detecting voiced audio segments, applause, multiple speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use different public data sets (e.g., TED talks) but your application should work life on real data! You may need to annotate some data manually or semi-manually, leverage data augmentation techniques to improve model quality.\n",

    "<img src=\"img/intro/project_option_2.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "Expected path:\n",
    "   * Week 1: Choose your project, read papers on the topic and search for a useful data set you'd like to start with\n",
    "   * Week 2-6: Train your model on the offline data, adjust for online operation, implement an Android / iOS app. If you need processing power to train your model, write an email to Olga (saukh@tugraz.at)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Mobile app development and machine learning are among the hottest skills\n",

The global mobile population amounted to 4 billion unique users, this is more than half of the world’s population that uses a mobile. The use of mobile continues to grow and increase, so it might be a good time to invest in developing some skills in mobile. The main mobile skills are Android and iOS mobile developer skills.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the first time in history we have plenty of computing and sensing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/intro/computation_and_sensing.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "However, every two years we create more data than we've created in all of history. Our ambitions are growing faster than our computers can improve. \n",

    "\"To manage data you need a lot of power; to extract insights into action you need a lot of computational power. Current architectures are just simply not sustainable.” – Antonio Neri, President and CEO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise. World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, January 2018.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is an __exponential increase of new data__ and an __exponential decrease in the time we can afford to go from sensing to acting__. The amount of information we record doubles every two years. The vast majority of this information is recorded in traditional data centres today, but as data continues to double that will change dramatically. The percentage of enterprise data that will never be in a data centre may rise from 10% today to more than 70% within five years. Seven out of 10 bytes could be captured, analysed and acted upon without leaving the “intelligent edge”.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although rich resources and high bandwidth make the cloud attractive to run public services, many private, personalized and real-time applications are better off when the models driving them run on mobile and embedded devices. __Edge computing__ allows for more secure and efficient data processing in real time, achieving better performance and results. While cloud computing operates on big data, edge computing operates on __instant data__, that is real-time data generated by sensors and users. It brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed to improve response times and save bandwidth. The increase in mobile and IoT devices at the edge of the network is producing a massive amount of data to be communicated to data centers and, thus, pushes the network’s bandwidth requirements to the limit. Despite the improvements of network technology, cloud services cannot guarantee acceptable response times, which is a critical requirement for many applications. The goal of edge computing is therefore to move the computation away from data centers towards the edge of the network exploiting embedded devices, mobile phones or network gateways to perform tasks and provide services on behalf of the cloud.\n",
