    "* Olga is in the lab 2-5pm every scheduled appointment (10-12am if necessary).\n",
    "* If you have questions / coding issues -- drop me an email (saukh@tugraz.at). It's easier to help if you use GitHub and I can access your code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Progress / Demos / Reports \n",
    "* Intermediate progress evaluation is based on your collaborative work as a team: How did you split the work? Your plan and your progress.\n",
