    "## 1. Conditional Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event given that (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) another event has occurred (source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability\">Wikipedia</a>).\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Bayesian Filters in One Slide (Discrete Case)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a robot resides in a one-dimensional world with no idea where it is in this world. Since our robot is completely clueless about its location, it believes that every point in this one dimensional world is equally likely to be its current position. We can describe this mathematically by saying that the robot's probability function is uniform (the same) over the sample space. This represents the state of maximum confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/localization/bayesian_filter_basics.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume there are three landmarks, which are three red doors that all look alike and we can distinguish a door from a non-door area (blue). Since the robot has just sensed that it is near a door, it assigns these locations greater probability (indicated by the bumps in the graph) whereas, all of the other locations have decreased belief. This function represents another probability distribution, called the posterior belief where the function is defined after the robot's sense measurement has been taken. The posterior function is the best representation of the robot's current belief, where each bump represents the robot's evaluation of its position relative to a door.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the robot moves to the right a certain distance, we can shift the belief according to the motion. Notice that all of the bumps also shift to the right, as we would expect. What may come as a surprise, however, is that these bumps have not shifted perfectly. They have also flattened. This flattening is due to the uncertainty in robot motion: since the robot doesn't know exactly how far it has moved, its knowledge has become less precise and so the bumps have become less sharp. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we shift and flatten these bumps, we are performing a convolution. Convolution is a mathematical operation that takes two functions and measures their overlap. To be more specific, it measures the amount of overlap as you slide one function over another. For example, if two functions have zero overlap, the value of their convolution will be equal to zero. If they overlap completely, their convolution will be equal to one. As we slide between these two extreme cases, the convolution will take on values between zero and one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our convolution, the first function is the belief function (labeled \"posterior\" above), and the second is the function which describes the distance moved, which we will address in more depth later. The result of this convolution is the shifted and flattened belief function shown below. Now, assume that after the robot moves it senses itself right next to a door again so that the measurement is the same as before. Just like after our first measurement, the sensing of a door will increase our probability function by a certain factor everywhere where there is a door. So, should we get the same posterior belief that we had after our first measurement? No! Because unlike with our first measurement, when we were in a state of maximum uncertainty, this time we have some idea of our location prior to sensing. This prior information, together with the second sensing of a door, combine to give us a new probability distribution, as shown in the bottom graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this graph we see a few minor bumps, but only one sharp peak. This peak corresponds to the second door. We have already explained this mathematically, but let's think intuitively about what happened. First, we saw the first door. This led us to believe that we were near some door, but we didn't know which. Then we moved and saw another door. We saw two doors in a row! So of course our probability function should have a major peak near the only location where we would expect to see two doors in a row.\n",
