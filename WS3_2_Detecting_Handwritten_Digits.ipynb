    "This is a handwritten character image (MNIST) classifier that can run on any Android device. The app stores a model  set of images (0-9) that we can cycle through and classify in order. It uses a pre-trained model to perform inference on the device. This idea can be applied to any images, both by using the camera and by pulling from the Web. We're using preloaded images so we can run the app in a simulator (no need for the device since it doesn't require a camera).\n",

    "When solving with a CPU an Optimization Problem, you Iteratively apply an Algorithm over some Input Data. In each of these iterations you usually update a Metric of your problem doing some Calculations on the Data. Now when the size of your data is large it might need a considerable amount of time to complete every iteration, and may consume a lot of resources. So sometimes you choose to apply these iterative calculations on a Portion of the Data to save time and computational resources. This portion is the batch_size and the process is called (in the Neural Network Lingo) batch data processing.\n",

    "In the neural network terminology:\n",
    "* one __epoch__ = one forward pass and one backward pass of all the training examples\n",

    "* number of __iterations__ = number of passes, each pass using [batch size] number of examples. To be clear, one pass = one forward pass + one backward pass (we do not count the forward pass and backward pass as two different passes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "* It requires less memory. Since you train network using less number of samples the overall training procedure requires less memory. It's especially important in case if you are not able to fit dataset in memory.\n",
    "* Typically networks trains faster with mini-batches. That's because we update weights after each propagation. In our example we've propagated 11 batches (10 of them had 100 samples and 1 had 50 samples) and after each of them we've updated network's parameters. If we used all samples during propagation we would make only 1 update for the network's parameter.\n",
