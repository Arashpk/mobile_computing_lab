    "\n",
    "__Machine learning__ has enabled us to build complex applications with great accuracy. Whether it has to do with images, videos, text or even audio, machine learning can solve problems from a wide range. Tensorflow can be used to achieve all of these applications. __TensorFlow__ is an open source software library for machine learning, developed by Google and currently used in many of their projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for its popularity is the ease with which developers can build and deploy applications. The GitHub projects we will look at during this workshop are very powerful but also so easy to work with. Moreover, Tensorflow was created with __processing power limitations__ in mind. The library can be ran on computers of all kinds, even on smartphones.\n",

    "### Machine learning\n",
    "Machine learning allows computers to __learn__. Traditionally, we always got computers to do things by providing a strict set of instructions. Machine Learning uses a very different approach. Instead of giving the computer a set of instructions on how to do something, we give it instructions on how to learn to do something. For example: think of a system that can classify pictures of animals as ‘cat’, ‘dog’, or ‘mouse’. Instead of manually finding unique characteristics from images of those animals and then coding it up, machine learning takes in images of those animals and finds characteristics and differences by itself. This process of teaching the computer is referred to as training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep learning\n",
    "Deep learning is a technique for implementing machine learning. It uses neural networks to learn, sometimes, using decision trees may also be referred to as deep learning, but for the most part deep learning involves the use of neural networks. You can imagine a neural network as a series of doors one after another and think of yourself as the ‘input’ to the neural network. Every time you open a door, you become a different person. By the time you open the last door, you have become a very different person. When you exit through the last door, you become the ‘output’ of the neural network. Each door, in this case, represents a layer. A neural network, therefore, is a collection of layers that transform the input in some way to produce an output.\n",
